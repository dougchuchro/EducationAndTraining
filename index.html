        <h3>Welcome to My Java Course Final Project</h3>

<p>This page provides information on my final project for <i>Java: Discovering It's Power</i>, the online Java programming language course offered by UC Berkeley Extension.</p>

<h3>Program Usage</h3>

<p>After downloading, unpacking, and compiling the code, you can invoke it with the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd root_project_dir
$ java com.chuchro.ucbx.javax4362.craps.Craps
</code></pre>

<p>This code was developed and compiled using Java version 1.7. While it may work in previos Java versions, I recommend using Java version 1.7 just to be safe. To check your Java version, enter the following command; you should see something similar to the output shown below.</p>

<pre><code>$ java -version
java version "1.7.0_15"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea7 2.3.7) (7u15-2.3.7-0ubuntu1~12.04.1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.7-b01, mixed mode)</code></pre>

<h3>Program Design</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>Program Documentation (JavaDoc)</h3>

<p>I've spent a good deal of time providing in-line documentation in every class. I've provided brief comment on each class, field, and method.  While next estensive, it should provide a good overview of how the design is structured.  I generated the documents using the javadoc utility provided in the Java Software Development Kit (SDK).  The docs can be found <a href="./doc/index.html">here</a>.

<h3>Code Repository on GitHub</h3>

<p>After the first few module of this course, I decided it was a good idea to use a source code management tool to track and manage the code I was writing for the module exercises. After a bit of research on different SCM tools, I decided to go use git. I also found out about GitHub, which provides free git-based code sharing repositories. I started using thier service as a remote backup for my local git repository and have found it very useful. It also allowed me to publish information using GitHub Pages (gh-pages), which is where this site is hosted. You can find my repository for this course at <a href="https://github.com/dougchuchro/EducationAndTraining">https://github.com/dougchuchro/EducationAndTraining</a>.</p>

<h3>Author and Acknowledgements</h3>

<p>The program was designed, written, tested, and document by me, <a href="mailto:doug@chuchro.net">Doug Chuchro</a>. You can find my GitHub profile <a href="https://github.com/dougchuchro" class="user-mention">here</a></p>
