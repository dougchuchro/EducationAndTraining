        <h3>Welcome to My Java Course Final Project</h3>

<p>This page provides information on my final project for <i>Java: Discovering It's Power</i>, the online Java programming language course offered by UC Berkeley Extension. For my final project, I decided to create a Java program that simulates Craps, the dice game that is popular at many casinos. The rest of this document refers to this Craps sumulator as the "program".</p>

<h3>Program Feature Overview</h3>

<p>The program attempts to simulate playing Craps, starting with initiating a session by having the player buy a specified amount of chips, then allowing the player to play a series of games and make and number of bets, to finally ending when the player runs out of chips or chooses to quit.  A player can place bets for the game (Pass line and Come line bets) or against the game (Don't Pass and Don't Come bets), and can place odds on these bets. Players can also place side bets that don't necessary hinge on the outcome of the game. Payouts are calculated based on the type and amount of the bet and the roll required to win in accorance with the payout rules established at most casinos.</p>

<p>For more infomration on the rules of Craps, please refer to the following sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craps">Craps</a> page on Wikipedia</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nextshooter.com/howtoplay">How to Play Craps</a> page on NextShooter.com</li>
</ul>

<h3>Program Limitations</h3>

<p>Beacuse of limits on time and maximum amount of code I could write, the program has limitations.  The major limitation are listed here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does not accomodate more than one player (unlike a craps table at a casino)</li>
<li>Does not allow "hardway" bets, e.g. hard-eight or hard-six</li>
<li>Does not all the player to buy more chips, the player must quit the program and restart to buy more chips</li>
<li>Does not allow the player to pull bets like Odds or Place bets from the table</li>
<li>Does not allow the player to bump up a bet amount after the bet has been made</li>
</ul>

<h3>Program Design</h3>

<p>The program design consists of seventeen (17) classes, each of which attempts to model actual physical objects (Die and Dice) or notional concepts like a Bet, Session, or Game.  To accomodate all of the different bet types, I used Java's object inheritance feature to code the abstract Bet class, which contains fields and methods common to all bets, then extend (and in some cases re-extended) it to create the classes that emulate the various types of bets, for a total of 11 bet classes.  While this seems complex, most of the bet classes are very simple, containing 20 lines of code or so, relying on thier super class to do all the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>I used enums in the following areas: to define the valid status of a bet, to define the valid rolls of a die, and to define the valid Place Bet and Proposition Bet types.  For these two kinds of bets, the different type are so simialar that it didn't justify creating a sperate class for each type.  For example, a Place bet on the SIX is alomst the same as a Place bet on the EIGHT.  However, I did need a way to define and access information on these bet types like their common name (e.g. a Proposition Bet on ELEVEN is commonly know as a "Yo" bet), the rolls that win the bet, and its payout ratio. I decided to create a static inner class (e.g. PlaceBetInfo) and a static Map that has the bet type enum value as its key and an instance of the static inner class as its value.  My constuctor would use the bet type that the player specified and look up this info in the static map and populate the appropriate member fields.  I'm not sure if this is considered good form in Java programming, but it seems to work pretty well.</p>

<h3>Program Usage</h3>

<p>After downloading, unpacking, and compiling the code, you can invoke it with the following command.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd root_project_dir
$ java com.chuchro.ucbx.javax4362.craps.Craps
</code></pre>

<p>This code was developed and compiled using Java version 1.7. While it may work in previous Java versions, I recommend using Java version 1.7 just to be safe. To check your Java version, enter the following command; you should see something similar to the output shown below.</p>

<pre><code>$ java -version
java version "1.7.0_15"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea7 2.3.7) (7u15-2.3.7-0ubuntu1~12.04.1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.7-b01, mixed mode)</code></pre>

<h3>Program Documentation (JavaDoc)</h3>

<p>I've spent a good deal of time providing in-line documentation in every class. I've provided brief comment on each class, field, and method.  Although it's not extensive, it should provide a good overview of how the design is structured.  I generated the documents using the javadoc utility provided in the Java Software Development Kit (SDK).  The docs can be found <a href="./doc/index.html">here</a>.

<h3>Code Repository on GitHub</h3>

<p>After the first few module of this course, I decided it was a good idea to use a source code management tool to track and manage the code I was writing for the module exercises. After a bit of research on different SCM tools, I decided to go use git. I also found out about GitHub, which provides free git-based code sharing repositories. I started using their service as a remote backup for my local git repository and have found it very useful. It also allowed me to publish information using GitHub Pages (gh-pages), which is where this site is hosted.
